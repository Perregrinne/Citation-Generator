# Citation-Generator
Generates APA and MLA citations

A simple, static web app to generate APA 7 and MLA 9 citations for works cited pages in papers. While a work in progress, it will be able to generate citations for books, web page articles, and online videos. You might still need to check the output to make sure it fits your teacher/professor's requirements. Some explicitly require things that others say not to include (for example, "Retreived from:" for URLs in APA 7 is required by some, and discouraged by others).

I got sick of other citation generator websites gunking up their websites with logins and forced ads (I think you should be allowed to use an ad blocker if you want), so I wrote this one. It's also meant to be as lightweight as possible (all HTML/CSS/JS I write should hopefully be no more than 100KB, uncompressed/non-minified).
